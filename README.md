## Solution used
For solving this problem I've decided to use the Breath First Search algorithm.

## How to improve
For smaller labyrinths such as the ones provided in the Challenge documentation, BFS is a suitable algorithm. However, I am aware that there could be some bigger labyrinths, up to 1000x1000. In this case, I am aware that there are more optimal solutions in regards time complexity. For example, the A*. 
I have prepared the code structure so I can add additional functions to solve the labyrinths using other algorithms.

## How to run
I am running the program through the terminal. 
The main function of the program contains the 4 tests provided inf the challenge document. You can select which test to execute changing the line "labyrinth = test1" to the other tests (test2, test3 and test4).
